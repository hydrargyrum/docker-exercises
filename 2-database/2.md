# 2.2. MariaDB container + connecting from the host

- install a mariadb client on the host
- start a `mariadb` container publishing TCP port 1234
    - in the container, `mariadb` exposes TCP port 3306
    - on the host, the port isn't published by default
    - publish port 1234 on host binding to container port 3306
- from the host, connect to mariadb using `mysql` command
    - don't attach to the container!
    - don't forget `--protocol=tcp`
- stop the container
