# 1.1. Simple shell

- start a container running `bash` shell inside an `oldstable` Debian distribution
- check the content of `/etc/debian_version` (`9.13` is expected)
- write something in `/foo` file
- exit the container

Then:

- start again a container with `bash` on `oldstable`
- check the content of `/foo` (the file should not exist)
