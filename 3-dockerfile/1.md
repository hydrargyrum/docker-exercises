# 3.1. build our own image with provisioned mariadb

- write a `Dockerfile` that uses image `mariadb` as base image
    - empty password must be allowed by default
- create a `myprovision.sql` file with the following content:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydb;
USE mydb;
CREATE TABLE tab (col TEXT);
INSERT INTO tab(col) VALUES("foo bar");
```

- the file must be copied in the image
- the file must be loaded by mariadb to create the initial schema
    - read carefully the `mariadb` image documentation
- build the image
- start a container running that image, without configuring persistence
- verify the database is provisioned with the sample data
